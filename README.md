This document contains eight exercises that accompany the course on optimal estimation. These exercises run  parallel with the lectures. They address the following topics:\
• Estimation of a static, single parameter: exercise 1 and 2 \
• Estimation of a static parameter vector: exercise 3 \
• Prediction in a linear dynamic system: exercise 4 \
• Estimation in a time-invariant, linear Gaussian system: exercise 5 \
• Estimation in a near-linear, near-Gaussian system: exercise 6 and 7 \
• Particle filtering exercise 7 \
• EKF-SLAM exercise 8 \
• Smoothing exercise 8
